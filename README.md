This is a frontend-only demo for a guesthouse site built with React + TypeScript + MUI styles.
Features:
- Multi-language (uk/en) via a simple i18n provider
- Fake authentication (localStorage)
- Booking form that stores bookings in localStorage
- Pages: Home, Rooms, Room detail, Booking, Gallery, About, Contacts, Login, Register, Profile

## How to run

```
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

Notes:
- This project is frontend-only. Any backend calls are replaced with localStorage stubs / placeholders.
